# Premium Website Strategy

## Overview
Deliver premium web experiences that behave like sales engines. Use this skill to plan scope, narrative, IA, and execution for conversion-focused sites.

## Quick Start
1. Define outcome, audience, primary CTA, and proof assets.
2. Select service tier and constraints (pages, timeline, platform).
3. Map page narrative and objections, then draft hero content.
4. Build IA and section order; enforce one primary CTA per section.
5. Apply technical polish, SEO sprint, and accessibility audit.
6. Prepare handover and post-launch support.

## Workflow

### 1. Discovery and Positioning
- Define the business goal and desired conversion.
- Identify the target audience and strongest proof assets.
- Capture constraints: platform, timeline, budget, number of pages.
- Choose tier and scope using `references/premium-website-framework.md`.

### 2. Narrative and Information Architecture
- Map a story arc: problem -> solution -> proof -> offer -> CTA.
- Assign one primary CTA per section; remove secondary distractions.
- Write in plain language; cut jargon and long blocks of text.

### 3. Hero and Above-the-Fold
- Apply the 3-second rule: clear headline, value prop, CTA, and proof.
- Use white space and hierarchy to reduce cognitive load.

### 4. Visual System and Motion
- Define typography, spacing, and layout rhythm early.
- Use motion with intention to guide attention, not decorate.
- Favor subtle hover or entrance effects; avoid heavy animation.

### 5. Build and Technical Execution
- Implement platform-specific enhancements (custom CSS, injections).
- Optimize performance: compress images and limit heavy scripts.
- Validate responsive behavior for mobile and desktop.

### 6. SEO Sprint
- Create a money page and supporting content cluster.
- Add internal links that reinforce the primary page.
- Ensure technical basics: SSL, metadata, image size targets.

### 7. Accessibility
- Verify contrast, alt text, keyboard navigation, and headings.

### 8. Handover and Management
- Provide training materials and 30-day support.
- Offer ongoing management or SEO sprint services.
