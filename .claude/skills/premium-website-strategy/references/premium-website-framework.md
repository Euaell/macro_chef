## Service tiers and scope

| Tier | Designation | Technical Scope | Strategic Focus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 1 | Fast, No-Code | Native platform features, limited pages (up to 4) | Speed to market and essential functionality. |
| Tier 2 | Custom Hybrid | Custom CSS styling, 5-week cap, up to 7 pages | Brand differentiation and visual polish. |
| Tier 3 | Unlimited High-End | Full custom code, unlimited pages and revisions | Authority and complex technical integration. |

## Project lifecycle

- Discovery call and brief
- Proposal and tier selection
- Design and narrative alignment
- Build and feedback loop (real-time markup tools)
- Handover training (recorded walkthroughs)
- 30-day post-launch support and ongoing services

## Conversion design principles

- Design for a distracted stranger with low attention.
- Apply the 3-second rule in the hero: clear headline, value prop, CTA, proof.
- Use white space to reduce cognitive load and create hierarchy.
- Control narrative with problem -> solution -> result case studies.
- Enforce choice architecture: one primary CTA per section.
- Replace jargon with plain, direct language.
- Ensure each section answers a question or objection.

## Technical execution

- Use motion with intention; over-animation hurts conversion.
- Add subtle hover or entrance effects to guide attention.
- Apply custom CSS for premium polish:
  - Round thumbnail corners
  - Hover zoom on images
  - Superscript formatting for trademarks or footnotes
  - Custom accordion buttons for richer interaction
- Inject header or footer code for analytics or sitewide functions.
- Maintain performance baselines:
  - Compress images (target under 250 KB each)
  - Limit heavy scripts and third-party widgets

## SEO sprint

- Create a money page for the primary keyword.
- Build a supporting content cluster that links back to the money page.
- Use internal links to reinforce relevance and authority.
- Ensure technical basics: SSL, metadata, structured headings, alt text.

## Accessibility audit

- Verify contrast ratios for all text.
- Add alt text for images.
- Ensure keyboard navigation and visible focus states.
- Use a logical heading hierarchy (H1-H6).

## Scaling and recurring services

- Package website management as a recurring service.
- Offer SEO sprints as high-value optimization projects.
- Use AI as a copilot for low-judgment tasks; keep strategy and client relations human-led.

## Strategic checklist

| Phase | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Discovery | Use AI to generate a deep-dive brief based on target audience psychographics. |
| Design | Implement the 3-second rule in the hero and keep value prop visible above the fold. |
| Development | Apply intentional motion (for example, image hover) to create a premium feel. |
| Optimization | Run an SEO sprint focusing on money pages and internal linking. |
| Accessibility | Audit WCAG basics: contrast, alt text, headings, keyboard access. |
| Management | Package handover instructions and ongoing support. |
